        <p> My Favourite book is the The Complete Adventures of Feluda.The books are written by author Satyajit Ray.It is a detective story following the detetective Feluda, his cousin Tapesh and their friend the crime-thriller writer Lalmohan Ganguli also known as Jatayu. Feluda is also known as the Indian Sherlock Holmes. Several devious villains appear throut the stories like Mr. Gore, Maganlal Meghraj, Batra, etc. I like the book because it has adventure, exciting twists and turns and a good story. It has a lot of facts and interesting general nowledge. I reccomend this book to everyone. </p>
